# TrumaBoilerDecode
An attempt at decoding the data between the Truma Control Panel and the Truma 4e Boiler. 
Noticed it was LIN format.
Made many assumptions in the decoding of this data.
Haven't tried hooking it up to a serial port yet, just using data captured.

Still to do, presume its possible to see;
actual air temperature
actual water temperature
control panel time/date
